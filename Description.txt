In the beginning all cards are in the deck, which is located at the left bottom corner.
Each turn 5 cards are drawn to the player. Or free spots for cards are filled up to 5 cards.
All the used cards move to the discard pile located at the right bottom corner.

Every card uses Mana, and mana regenerates after every turn (back and forth to the player), or when an
enemy dies. There are three different enemies. To win against all, you have to use your cards wisely. 
The game Ends if you die, or you kill all three enemies.
The first enemy is easy - It only deals damage at its turn
The second enemy is medium - It has more HP, deals damage and steals the card from player's hand
The third enemy is hard (BOSS) - It has a lot of HP, deals damage and steals the card from player's hand
If the enemy steals the card it gets stacked on top of the enemy.
