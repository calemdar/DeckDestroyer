In this project we created a game called Deck destroyer.
This is a card based adventure game where you fight against monsters as Heisenberg.
We implemented all essential features such as:
- Cards
- Deck
- Hand
- Player
- Enemy
- Health
- Clicking on cards
- Game start
- Game win
- Game Lose
- Reticle
- Turn system
- Initial Sprites
- Audio

We are using the Dragonfly engine provided by Prof. Claypool. make sure you have the engineand the
SFML2.5 outside the directory with this README file.
This verison is build for Windows x64. In order to run the project. Open up the .sln (Solution) file,
and click debug.

In order to play the game, simply hit the "P" button to start the game after seeing the start screen.
Then you can clickon the cards to use them. We only have one type of card, whereas we aim to get at
least 10 different cards with 3 different types. Right now you dont have to end turn to play cards. If you end turn the enemy should attack you (decrease your health by 10). Have fun!!
